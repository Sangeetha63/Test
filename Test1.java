3.* generalised is a class and parent class
  *specialized is  class and child class

4.a) not use extend keyword
b)  class program{
	private String name;
	
}
c)delegation is alternatives to inheritance

5.*CompareTo
  *Comparable

6.      Arraylist:
* its is internally use array
* it is faster in read operation
* it is slower in write operation                           

      LinkedList:
* its is internally use nodes
* it is slower in read operation
* it is  faster in write operation 


7.     iterator:
* its is forward
*it is add method

      listIterator:
*it is a forward and backward 
* its is both add and remove method


8.Covariant method in overriding in java
= it is child class and return type is vary.


9.memory leakages in java
=object present in heap memory and it removed by Garbage  collector.


10. static plymorphism:
     *function call with obiject in complile time
=    * it is called method overloading
     * different return type



   Dynamic polymorphism:
   *function call with obiject in runt time
=  *it is called as method overriding
   *same return type

11.Encapsulation
