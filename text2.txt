main interface

  list = *it is  a indexed based                      
        *allow duplicates
		*possiontal 
		*insertion order
		
		
	SET=*it is  not indexed based
        *not allow duplicates
		* not possiontal
		* not insertion order	
		
		
		
		ARRAYLIST: it use internally arrays
		           * faster in read operation
				   *not in write operation
		
		
		LinkedList: it use internally node
		           * slower in read operation
				   *faster in write operation
		
	2. MAP INTERFACES=
* hashset
*hashmap

	hashmap:
	*it  allow duplicates
	*it implememnted by map	
		
		
		hashset:
		
	*it  not allow duplicates
	*it implememnted by set
	
		
3.            Hash set                                                  tree set
*The Hash set is executed with the help of a HashTable.	    *The tree set is executed with the help of a tree structure.
*	It does not authorise a heterogeneous object.	          *    It authorises a heterogeneous object.
*	It permits a null object.	                              *It does not permit the null object.
*	To compare two objects, we use the equals method.	      * To compare two objects, we use the compare method.
*	It does not support any order	                           * TreeSet supports an object in sorted order.	
		
	
4. by array and linked set hashmap implememnted injava
*by get and put operation its use hascode and equals method



5. fail fast:The iterator in Java is used to traverse over a collection's objects. 
   fail safe iterator:  A fail-safe iterator does not throw any exceptions unless it can
                     handle if the collection is modified during the iteration process

6.

7. An object for traversing and partitioning elements of a source

8.*Locate a character position within a string.
 Locate a sequence of characters within a string.
Copy a string.
Concatenate strings.
Compare strings.
Translate a string.
Measure a string.


9.Spring core=Spring Framework is a widely used Java EE framework for building applications

10. Dependency Injection is a fundamental aspect of the Spring framework, through which the Spring container 
                 “injects” objects into other objects or “dependencies”
				 it acheive my constuctor or setter method

11.* @ComponentScan annotation is used to find beans and the corresponding injected with @Autowired annotation.


12.yes
13.               StringBuffer                                      StringBuilder

     StringBuffer is synchronized i.e. thread safe.       	*StringBuilder is non-synchronized i.e. not thread safe.  
	StringBuffer is less efficient than StringBuilder.	     *StringBuilder is more efficient than StringBuffer.
	StringBuffer was introduced in Java 1.0	                  * StringBuilder was introduced in Java 1.5

14. bean factory                              Application context
 NoAnnotation support	                 YesAnnotation support
 not Internationalization	                 Internationalization
 not in Enterprise services	                    in Enterprise services

15.*Spring AOP=aspects are implemented using regular classes  or 
             regular classes annotated with the @Aspect annotation . 

	*IOC= the Spring Framework implementation of the Inversion of Control (IoC)principle.
	*POJO=	POJO in Java stands for Plain Old Java Object. 
	      It is an ordinary object, which is not bound by any special restriction.
	*@Component= to detect beans	
	*@ComponentScan= to find beans	
     *@Bean=returns beans

17.*maven:allows package executed jar.
*gradle: it build tool.
*tomcat:used for building web applications.	 
*quarkus:optimizes java.
*sonarqube:used to detect bugs.
*server:used to run user applications.
